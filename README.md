The animated GIF above is captured from an 2018 Apple 9.7" iPad. The clip shows an iPad moving over a 3D model of Goclenius crater. The yellow dots are ARKit computer vision tracking features points (in this case, the iPad is moving along a book shelf on the left side).

To do this, you need:
1. Apple 9.7" iPad (tested on 2018 model, A9 CPU or higher for ARKit, should work on 2017 model)
2. Swift Playgrounds (2.2) from iOS App Store
3. The OWL Stereoscopic Viewer from The London Stereoscopic Company Ltd https://www.londonstereo.com/

It is advisable to get a protective silicon case for the iPad to minimize the stereoscope sliding on the screen. The stereoscopic viewer is held in place by the user to allow switching between viewing and programming Swift.
